        m.put("What is precision agriculture?"," Precision agriculture is a farming management concept that uses technology to optimize crop yields and reduce waste.");
        m.put("How does precision agriculture work?","Precision agriculture works by collecting and analyzing data on crops, soil, and weather conditions. This data is then used to create targeted and efficient farming practices.");
        m.put("What are the benefits of precision agriculture?","The benefits of precision agriculture include increased crop yields, reduced waste, and more efficient use of resources like water and fertilizer.");
        m.put("What is sustainable agriculture?","Sustainable agriculture is a farming system that focuses on producing food in a way that is environmentally and socially responsible, while also ensuring economic viability for farmers.");
        m.put("How does sustainable agriculture differ from conventional agriculture?","Sustainable agriculture differs from conventional agriculture in that it focuses on long-term environmental and social sustainability, rather than just short-term economic gain.");
        m.put("What are some sustainable agriculture practices?","Some sustainable agriculture practices include crop rotation, cover cropping, conservation tillage, and integrated pest management.");
        m.put("What is integrated pest management?"," Integrated pest management is a pest control strategy that uses a combination of techniques, including natural predators, cultural controls, and chemical controls, to manage pest populations");
        m.put("What are cover crops?","Cover crops are crops that are planted in between cash crops to help improve soil health and fertility.");
        m.put("What is crop rotation?","Crop rotation is a farming practice in which different crops are planted in the same field in successive growing seasons to help reduce soil erosion and improve soil health");
        m.put("What is conservation tillage?","Conservation tillage is a farming practice that involves reducing the amount of tillage or plowing done on a field in order to help reduce soil erosion and improve soil health.");
        m.put("What is organic farming?","Organic farming is a farming system that avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and focuses on using natural methods to manage crops and livestock.");
        m.put("What are some benefits of organic farming?","Some benefits of organic farming include improved soil health, reduced environmental impact, and increased biodiversity.");
        m.put("What is agroforestry?","Agroforestry is a farming system that involves growing crops and trees together in a way that benefits both the crops and the environment.");
        m.put("What are some benefits of agroforestry?","Some benefits of agroforestry include improved soil health, increased biodiversity, and reduced environmental impact.");
        m.put("What is hydroponics?","Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, using nutrient-rich water instead.");
        m.put("What are some benefits of hydroponics?","Some benefits of hydroponics include more efficient use of water and nutrients, and the ability to grow crops in areas where soil is not suitable for farming.");
        m.put("What is aquaponics?","Aquaponics is a method of farming that combines aquaculture (raising fish) with hydroponics (growing plants without soil).");
        m.put("What are some benefits of aquaponics?","Some benefits of aquaponics include increased crop yields, reduced water use, and the ability to grow both crops and fish in the same system.");
        m.put("What is vertical farming?","Vertical farming is a method of farming that involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, using artificial light and controlled environments.");
        m.put("What are some benefits of vertical farming?","Some benefits of vertical farming include increased crop yields, reduced use of water and land, and the ability to grow crops in urban areas.");
        m.put("What is regenerative agriculture?","Regenerative agriculture is a farming system that focuses on");
        m.put("What is soil health?","Soil health refers to the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil that support plant growth and productivity.");
        m.put("How can farmers improve soil health?","Farmers can improve soil health by reducing tillage, planting cover crops, adding organic matter to the soil, and reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.");
        m.put("What is precision livestock farming?","Precision livestock farming is a management concept that uses technology to monitor and optimize the health and productivity of livestock.");
        m.put("What are some technologies used in precision livestock farming?","Technologies used in precision livestock farming include sensors, monitoring systems, and automated feeding and watering systems.");
        m.put("What is the role of agriculture in sustainable development?","Agriculture plays a critical role in sustainable development by providing food and income for people, while also preserving natural resources and promoting economic growth.");
